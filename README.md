# QT3 Urukul 9910 Control
This repository serves as documentation for interfacing with the Urukul 9910 DDS board in combination with the Kasli FPGA controller, using the ARTIQ control system. The goal of this project is to accurately generate and manipulate RF signals to drive the control system for our quantum expirements.
